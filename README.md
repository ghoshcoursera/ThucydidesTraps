# Thucydides' Traps
Predicting outcomes of Thucydides’ Traps using Machine Learning.
----------------------------------------------------------------
In the book 'Destined for War', Allison uses the phrase 'Thucydides’ Trap' which, according to him, refers to the theory that ”when one great power threatens to displace another, war is almost always the result”.

In this repo, I've created the Thucydides' Traps Mathematica Notebook with the code and data required to predict outcomes of Thucydides’ Traps.
The notebook uses a simple code to transform the text data obtained from Harvard University into numbers and uses Machine Learning to predict outcomes of Thucydides’ Traps.
